## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- vanilla JavaScript ES6 syntax (using modules)
- Figma (for working out dimensions of elements)



### What I learned

Upon looking at the Starter Files, both review profiles were hard-coded into the HTML. After putting them in a separate JS file (as objects in an array). At first I thought that maybe I had to do an fetch/await call, but then I remembered learning about modules; exporting and importing (like you would do in React). First encounter modules in Scrimba's JavaScript Bootcamp course

I had also just gone through [Build 15 JavaScript Projects - Vanilla JavaScript Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PHXvlpOkf4) and by conincidence we did a similar Review exercise

### Continued development

I'm definitely going to do more projects where I will 

### Useful resources
